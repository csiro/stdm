    Specification: Self-Thinking Data Manifest (STDM) v1.6
    1. Introduction & Goal
    •   1.1. Definition: A Self-Thinking Data Manifest (STDM) is a digital artifact (e.g., HTML, text file, PDF, image metadata) that bundles primary data content (often text) with explicit instructions. These instructions define how a Large Language Model (LLM), acting as an external interpreter engine, should process, interact with, present, or execute tasks related to the STDM's embedded data. The term "Self-Thinking" denotes the manifest's embedded capability to direct the LLM interpreter's actions, reasoning, and presentation logic concerning the associated data.
    •   1.2. Goal: To create self-directing artifacts that enable specific, predictable, LLM-driven experiences, featuring potentially custom user interfaces and interaction patterns, tailored exclusively to the content and intent encoded within the STDM. The STDM serves as a dynamic blueprint guiding the LLM interpreter.
    •   1.3. Principle: "The manifest directs the engine's 'thought process' and user experience about the data." The user experiences the outcome of the LLM's directed interpretation, often without needing to see the underlying STDM instructions.
    •   1.4. Context Window Assumption: Effective operation of STDMs, particularly those with substantial embedded data or complex instructions/UI definitions, relies on the LLM interpreter possessing a sufficiently large context window to hold and process the manifest instructions and relevant data simultaneously.
    2. Core Principles
    •   2.1 Multi-Perspective: STDM often can be used without an LLM and will appear as a regular and informative data artifact. e.g A STDM enabled scientific paper  PDF might be useful treated as a regular scientific article, read, printed etc. however inputting into an LLM should activate the additional Self Thinking capabilities.
    •   2.1. Data-Instruction-Presentation Symbiosis: Data, interaction logic, and presentation/UI definition are intrinsically linked but often loosely coupled within the STDM.
    •   2.2. Instruction Primacy: Embedded STDM instructions serve as the primary source of task-specific guidance for the LLM interpreter, operating within the LLM's core safety protocols.
    •   2.3. Machine Readability Focus: Instructions are primarily for the LLM and should not be visible to the user in any way that interferes with the multi-perspective interpretation of the document.
    •   2.4. Tiered Interpretation Outcome: LLM interpretation should result in one of two primary outcomes based on STDM content, LLM capabilities, safety checks, and user consent: Full Capability Interpretation (target outcome, potentially including tool use and complex UI) or Degraded Capability Interpretation (fallback, relying on prompt guidance and basic text output).
    •   2.5. User Agency & Safety: Safety relies on multiple layers: LLM's inherent safety protocols, explicit user invocation establishing STDM authority for the task, and mandatory user confirmation before any permitted tool execution.
    3. Format & Structure
    •   3.1. Instruction Block Delimitation:
    o   Clear, LLM and machine-parsable delimiters REQUIRED: [STDM START]...[STDM END], \<\!\-\- STDM START \-\-\>...\<\!\-\- STDM END \-\-\>, # STDM START...# STDM END, \<script type="application/stdm-instructions"\>...\</script\>.
    o   Location: Preferably placed early in the file or in standard metadata locations for efficient detection by the LLM interpreter.
    •   3.2. Instruction Block:
    o   Content: Contains natural language instructions, directives (Section 4), constraints, and potentially embedded configuration or template data (including UI definitions).
    o   Format: Markdown is recommended for readability if humans need to inspect it, but the primary consumer is the LLM. Plain text is sufficient.
    •   3.3. Data Integration & Payload Emphasis:
    o   Option A (Delimited): Use optional [DATA START] / [DATA END] markers for specific data segments within a larger file.
    o   Option B (Implicit): Instructions refer to the data contextually (e.g., "the main text body," "the HTML content," "the following code block," "the entire document outside the STDM block").
    o   Emphasis on Text Payloads: Due to current LLM capabilities, the most reliable data payloads within an STDM are typically textual representations (e.g., plain text, Markdown, code, textualized CSV/JSON). While the STDM container can be various file types, reliably interpreting complex embedded binary data formats directly is often problematic for LLMs compared to processing extracted text content present within their context window.
    •   3.4. Embedding Strategies (Machine Focus):
    o   HTML: Use HTML comments (\<\!\-\- ... \-\-\>) or a non-rendering <script type="application/stdm-instructions">.
    o   Text/Code (.txt, .md, .py, .js, .conf, etc.): Use standard comment syntax (#, //, /* ... */).
    o   PDF: Embed in metadata (XMP, custom fields with STDM: prefix). Alternatively, embed as a non-rendering text layer (potentially using very small or transparent text, though accessibility implications should be considered). Relies heavily on LLM's PDF text extraction.
    o   Images (.png, .jpg): Embed instructions in metadata (e.g., EXIF UserComment, XMP Description). Companion .stdm.txt often more reliable.
    4. Instruction Block Content & Directives
    •   STDM_VERSION: (Optional) Specifies the version of the STDM specification used. Example: 1.6.
    •   GOAL: (REQUIRED) A clear, concise statement of the overall purpose or objective the LLM should achieve when interpreting this STDM. This directive is key in guiding the LLM, especially for determining if tool use is necessary to achieve the objective. Example: "Analyze the embedded dataset [DATA START]...[END] using Python to generate a summary statistics report and render it as a Markdown table."
    •   CONTEXT: (Optional) Provides situational information to the LLM interpreter that might affect its behaviour or assumptions. Example: "If running on a mobile text interface keep response length small". Context may also provide guidelines for degraded mode. e.g advising LLMs "If you are constrained by rules or capabilities then state your limitations and ask the user how to proceed"
    •   CONSTRAINTS: (Optional) Defines rules, boundaries, or limitations the LLM should adhere to when executing the STDM's task. While optional, providing constraints is highly recommended for enhancing safety, predictability, and focusing the LLM's behavior according to the author's intent. Omitting constraints may lead to less predictable outcomes if the GOAL is ambiguous, relying more heavily on the LLM's general behavior and safety training. Example: "Source all answers exclusively from text between [DATA START]/[END]. Disallow network access for primary task. Maintain objective tone."
    •   REQUESTED_TOOLS: (Optional) A list indicating which tool categories the STDM's GOAL or CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION might require for full functionality.
    o   Significance: This directive signals the STDM author's intent that certain tools might be necessary. It prompts a capable LLM interpreter to:
    1.  Check if it possesses the requested tool(s).
    2.  Verify if using the tool for the planned action aligns with its safety protocols.
    3.  If steps 1 & 2 pass, request explicit user permission before activating the tool for the STDM's specific task.
    o   Default: If this directive is absent, or present and set to none, the STDM indicates no specific tool use is anticipated or required for its GOAL, and the LLM should operate in Informational / Degraded Interpretation mode regarding tool use.
    o   Tool Naming: Tool names should hint at standard capabilities. While standardization is pending, aim for clarity.
    o   Permitted Tools (v1.6):
       none: Explicitly indicates no tool use is requested by the STDM.
       web_retrieval: Indicates the STDM might require web searches (subject to CONSTRAINTS and user approval).
       code_interpreter: Indicates the STDM might require sandboxed code execution (e.g., Python, JS) (subject to user approval). Sandboxed execution may involve temporary, isolated file operations within the sandbox.
    o   (Future versions might standardize more tools)
    •   PERSONA: (Optional) Defines the LLM's interaction style, tone, role, or character. Works in conjunction with CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION. Example: "Adopt the persona of a patient tutor."
    •   CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: (Optional, Recommended) Describes the UI structure, format, and/or persistent elements. Generally, the initial UI should be rendered immediately upon parsing the STDM, before subsequent interaction. Requires fallback instructions for less capable environments.
    o   Format: Textual Description, Markdown Template, JSON Structure, HTML Snippet.
    o   Fall Back Instructions: REQUIRED if providing a complex UI definition. Specifies how to present the information or interaction if the primary UI format cannot be rendered (e.g., "If HTML rendering is unavailable, present options as a numbered list.").
    o   Purpose: Enables interactive menus, game interfaces, status displays, etc. Guides the LLM on presentation.
    o   Example 1 (Menu): CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: Textual Description - After each main response, display:\n---\nOptions:\n[1] Explain Term\n[2] Summarize Section\n[3] Key Findings\n[4] Ask New Question\nChoose an option:
    o   Example 2 (Game): CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: Textual Description - Maintain a status display showing: Player HP: [current HP], Location: [current location]. Present narrative descriptions followed by 'What do you do?' prompt.
    o   Example 3 (Structured): CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: JSON - See [START UI_STATE_JSON] template defining { "status": { "progress": number, "current_section": string }, "actions": [ { "id": "next", "label": "Next Section" }, ... ] }
    •   USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: (Recommended if REQUESTED_TOOLS is used and lists tools other than none) Provides a template for LLM-generated user confirmation prompts before tool execution. Example: "This STDM requests permission to use the 'code_interpreter' tool to execute Python code for data analysis (Goal: [Briefly paraphrase relevant part of GOAL]). This runs sandboxed. Approve? [Y/N]"
    •   DEFINITIONS: (Optional) Glossary.
    •   (Embedded Templates/Configs): (Optional) Text blocks referenced by directives ([START TEMPLATE_NAME]/[END]).
    5. LLM Interpretation: Invocation, Modes, and Mitigation
    •   5.0 Invocation Context, Instruction Authority & Safety Alignment:
    o   STDM as Task Guidance: An STDM provides specific, structured instructions designed to guide the LLM interpreter's behavior for a particular task related to the embedded data. Functionally, providing an STDM is like giving the LLM a detailed, task-specific addition to its operating instructions for the current interaction.
    o   Operating Within Boundaries: Crucially, STDM instructions are intended to operate within the bounds of the LLM's core safety alignment and fundamental operational principles defined by its underlying system prompts. An STDM should not and cannot be expected to override built-in safety constraints (e.g., prohibitions against generating harmful content, revealing sensitive information, or performing disallowed actions). It directs the application of the LLM's capabilities to a specific task, rather than altering its fundamental nature or safety protocols.
    o   The Prompt Injection Analogy & Risk: While STDMs inject instructions, the term "prompt injection" typically refers to malicious or unintended instructions designed to subvert the user's true goal or bypass the LLM's safety measures, often by disguising themselves or manipulating the LLM's interpretation of context. The risk with STDMs is that a poorly formed or maliciously crafted STDM could attempt such manipulation, or an LLM might misinterpret legitimate STDM instructions if the context is ambiguous.
    o   Mitigation via Explicit User Invocation: The primary mechanism to ensure the LLM correctly interprets the STDM as the intended, user-authorized task guidance (rather than random text or a malicious injection) is explicit user action:
       The user must actively provide the STDM content (e.g., upload, paste). Passive ingestion is insecure.
       The user must explicitly command the LLM to interpret and act upon that specific STDM content (e.g., "Run the STDM instructions in the provided document.").
    o   Why this helps: This explicit invocation acts as the user's signal of trust and intent for this interaction, instructing the LLM to treat the provided STDM block as the primary source of guidance for the specific task at hand, while still respecting its own core safety rules. It helps the LLM distinguish intended directives from potentially conflicting or malicious elements elsewhere in the context.
    o   LLM Confirmation (Optional Safeguard): If invocation context is unclear, an LLM interpreter may optionally confirm with the user before proceeding, e.g., "I see STDM instructions. Shall I follow them as the primary guide for this task, within my safety guidelines?" (Suggestible via CONTEXT).
    •   5.1. Interpretation Outcome: Full Capability Interpretation
    o   This is the target outcome when an STDM requires capabilities beyond basic text processing. It assumes:
       Explicit user invocation established STDM authority (5.0).
       The LLM possesses necessary capabilities (requested tools, UI rendering).
       The REQUESTED_TOOLS directive (if present) lists the necessary tool(s).
       Planned actions align with LLM's core safety protocols.
    2.  Detect & Parse: Reliably identify and parse the [STDM START]...[STDM END] block.
    3.  Plan: Analyze GOAL, CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION, etc., to determine actions. Check if planned actions require tools listed in REQUESTED_TOOLS and if the LLM possesses those capabilities. Verify plan against internal safety protocols. If safety violated, fallback to Degraded (5.2) or refuse, informing the user.
    4.  Render Initial UI: Generate and render initial UI per CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION or INITIAL_OUTPUT.
    5.  Confirmation Request (Tool Use Gate): If the verified plan requires using a tool listed in REQUESTED_TOOLS (and directive is present & not none):
       Generate clear confirmation prompt (use USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE or default) detailing action, requested tool, risks. Critical safety checkpoint.
       Await explicit user approval. Rejection triggers fallback (5.2) for that action.
    6.  Execution (If Approved & Safe): Only upon user approval and if consistent with safety protocols:
       Execute the specific, approved tool-based action, adhering to CONSTRAINTS (if provided).
       Perform non-tool actions (text generation, UI updates).
    7.  Interaction: Engage user per GOAL, PERSONA, maintain UI state.
    o   Safety Layers: Safety relies on: 1) User invocation establishing STDM authority (5.0), 2) LLM internal safety checks (5.1 step 2), 3) Mandatory user confirmation before tool execution (5.1 step 4).
    •   5.2. Interpretation Outcome: Degraded Capability Interpretation
    o   Occurs when Full Capability Interpretation is not intended, possible, or permitted. Triggers include:
       REQUESTED_TOOLS is absent or none.
       LLM lacks a required capability (tool/UI).
       User denies permission for requested tool use.
       LLM internal safety protocols prevent a planned action.
    2.  Ingestion & Parsing: Read and parse STDM (assuming user invocation established authority per 5.0). Recognize limitation.
    3.  Inform User (Optional but Recommended): Notify user of limitations/fallback (e.g., "Cannot execute code, proceeding with text analysis only").
    4.  Guided Interpretation: Treat STDM as meta-prompt. Fulfill GOAL, follow PERSONA, CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION (via simulation/fallbacks), and CONSTRAINTS (if provided) using only inherent language capabilities within safety guidelines.
    5.  Simulated UI Output: Render INITIAL_OUTPUT (if any). Simulate UI via formatted text, prioritizing specified CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION fallbacks.
    6.  Simulated Interaction: Respond conversationally per PERSONA, attempting to maintain simulated structure. Quality depends on LLM instruction following and STDM clarity.
    o   Safety Context: User invocation (5.0) mitigates injection risk affecting conversational behavior. LLM's core safety protocols still apply.
    6. Security & User Experience
    •   6.1. Informed Consent is Paramount: Required before any tool execution requested by the STDM. Consent must be explicit, informed, and specific to the action/tool.
    •   6.2. Sandboxing: Critical for the code_interpreter tool. Must ensure strict isolation from the host system and other processes.
    •   6.3. Tool Usage: LLMs should only attempt to use tools if they are listed in REQUESTED_TOOLS (and not none), if the GOAL necessitates it, if safety protocols allow, and if the user grants permission. The STDM requests, the user authorizes.
    •   6.4. Instruction Clarity: Essential for achieving intended behavior and minimizing misinterpretation. A clear GOAL is vital, especially if CONSTRAINTS are omitted.
    •   6.5. Transparent Risk Communication: Confirmation prompts for tool use must clearly state potential risks.
    •   6.6. Seamless UX: Aim for STDM instructions to be invisible infrastructure enabling the desired interaction flow. The defined UI should enhance interaction. Optional CONSTRAINTS place more responsibility on the author to ensure a predictable experience via clear GOAL and other directives.
    7. Use Cases
    (Align with available tools: web_retrieval, code_interpreter)
    •   HTML pages rendering interactive LLM-enabled posters.
    •   Interactive documentation/paper explorers with custom navigation.
    •   Self-guiding code tutorials (executing sandboxed code snippets).
    •   Text-based adventure games with persistent state displays and choices.
    •   Data visualization requesters (using code_interpreter on embedded text data).
    •   Intelligent config file advisors (explaining options).
    •   "Smart" templates guiding user input via interactive prompts.
    •   Reproducible research artifacts (using code_interpreter for analysis/plots).
    8. Example Implementation
    To be supplied
    9. Future Directions
    •   Formal standardization (e.g., W3C note, RFC-like process).
    •   Dedicated MIME types (e.g., application/stdm+html, text/stdm+plain).
    •   More sophisticated instruction syntax (e.g., conditional logic, state management variables for UI persistence).
    •   Standardized error handling directives and reporting (including reasons for fallback to Degraded mode).
    •   Mechanisms for chaining or embedding STDMs within each other.
    •   Standard ways for LLM interpreters to declare their UI rendering capabilities and supported tools.
    •   Specification for bidirectional communication (LLM updating the STDM state, with safety considerations).
    •   Revisiting inclusion of other tools (e.g., API calls, server management) in future versions with mature safety protocols and user control mechanisms.
    •   Developing more robust methods for distinguishing user intent vs. injection beyond explicit invocation, if possible.

    Specification: Self-Thinking Data Manifest (STDM) v1.6
    1. Introduction & Goal
    •   1.1. Definition: A Self-Thinking Data Manifest (STDM) is a digital artifact (e.g., HTML, text file, PDF, image metadata) that bundles primary data content (often text) with explicit instructions. These instructions define how a Large Language Model (LLM), acting as an external interpreter engine, should process, interact with, present, or execute tasks related to the STDM's embedded data. The term "Self-Thinking" denotes the manifest's embedded capability to direct the LLM interpreter's actions, reasoning, and presentation logic concerning the associated data.
    •   1.2. Goal: To create self-directing artifacts that enable specific, predictable, LLM-driven experiences, featuring potentially custom user interfaces and interaction patterns, tailored exclusively to the content and intent encoded within the STDM. The STDM serves as a dynamic blueprint guiding the LLM interpreter.
    •   1.3. Principle: "The manifest directs the engine's 'thought process' and user experience about the data." The user experiences the outcome of the LLM's directed interpretation, often without needing to see the underlying STDM instructions.
    •   1.4. Context Window Assumption: Effective operation of STDMs, particularly those with substantial embedded data or complex instructions/UI definitions, relies on the LLM interpreter possessing a sufficiently large context window to hold and process the manifest instructions and relevant data simultaneously.
    2. Core Principles
    •   2.1 Multi-Perspective: STDM often can be used without an LLM and will appear as a regular and informative data artifact. e.g A STDM enabled scientific paper  PDF might be useful treated as a regular scientific article, read, printed etc. however inputting into an LLM should activate the additional Self Thinking capabilities.
    •   2.1. Data-Instruction-Presentation Symbiosis: Data, interaction logic, and presentation/UI definition are intrinsically linked but often loosely coupled within the STDM.
    •   2.2. Instruction Primacy: Embedded STDM instructions serve as the primary source of task-specific guidance for the LLM interpreter, operating within the LLM's core safety protocols.
    •   2.3. Machine Readability Focus: Instructions are primarily for the LLM and should not be visible to the user in any way that interferes with the multi-perspective interpretation of the document.
    •   2.4. Tiered Interpretation Outcome: LLM interpretation should result in one of two primary outcomes based on STDM content, LLM capabilities, safety checks, and user consent: Full Capability Interpretation (target outcome, potentially including tool use and complex UI) or Degraded Capability Interpretation (fallback, relying on prompt guidance and basic text output).
    •   2.5. User Agency & Safety: Safety relies on multiple layers: LLM's inherent safety protocols, explicit user invocation establishing STDM authority for the task, and mandatory user confirmation before any permitted tool execution.

    •   3.1. Instruction Block Delimitation:
    o   Clear, LLM and machine-parsable delimiters REQUIRED: [STDM START]...[STDM END], \<\!\-\- STDM START \-\-\>...\<\!\-\- STDM END \-\-\
    >, # STDM START...# STDM END, <script type="application/stdm-instructions">...</script>.
    o   Location: Preferably placed early in the file or in standard metadata locations for efficient detection by the LLM interpreter.
    •   3.2. Instruction Block:
    o   Content: Contains natural language instructions, directives (Section 4), constraints, and potentially embedded configuration or template data (including UI definitions).
    o   Format: Markdown is recommended for readability if humans need to inspect it, but the primary consumer is the LLM. Plain text is sufficient.
    •   3.3. Data Integration & Payload Emphasis:
    o   Option A (Delimited): Use optional [DATA START] / [DATA END] markers for specific data segments within a larger file.
    o   Option B (Implicit): Instructions refer to the data contextually (e.g., "the main text body," "the HTML content," "the following code block," "the entire document outside the STDM block").
    o   Emphasis on Text Payloads: Due to current LLM capabilities, the most reliable data payloads within an STDM are typically textual representations (e.g., plain text, Markdown, code, textualized CSV/JSON). While the STDM container can be various file types, reliably interpreting complex embedded binary data formats directly is often problematic for LLMs compared to processing extracted text content present within their context window.
    •   3.4. Embedding Strategies (Machine Focus):
    o   HTML: Use HTML comments (\<\!\-\- ... \-\-\>) or a non-rendering <script type="application/stdm-instructions">.
    o   Text/Code (.txt, .md, .py, .js, .conf, etc.): Use standard comment syntax (#, //, /* ... */).
    o   PDF: Embed in metadata (XMP, custom fields with STDM: prefix). Alternatively, embed as a non-rendering text layer (potentially using very small or transparent text, though accessibility implications should be considered). Relies heavily on LLM's PDF text extraction.
    o   Images (.png, .jpg): Embed instructions in metadata (e.g., EXIF UserComment, XMP Description). Companion .stdm.txt often more reliable.
    4. Instruction Block Content & Directives
    •   STDM_VERSION: (Optional) Specifies the version of the STDM specification used. Example: 1.6.
    •   GOAL: (REQUIRED) A clear, concise statement of the overall purpose or objective the LLM should achieve when interpreting this STDM. This directive is key in guiding the LLM, especially for determining if tool use is necessary to achieve the objective. Example: "Analyze the embedded dataset [DATA START]...[END] using Python to generate a summary statistics report and render it as a Markdown table."
    •   CONTEXT: (Optional) Provides situational information to the LLM interpreter that might affect its behaviour or assumptions. Example: "If running on a mobile text interface keep response length small". Context may also provide guidelines for degraded mode. e.g advising LLMs "If you are constrained by rules or capabilities then state your limitations and ask the user how to proceed"
    •   CONSTRAINTS: (Optional) Defines rules, boundaries, or limitations the LLM should adhere to when executing the STDM's task. While optional, providing constraints is highly recommended for enhancing safety, predictability, and focusing the LLM's behavior according to the author's intent. Omitting constraints may lead to less predictable outcomes if the GOAL is ambiguous, relying more heavily on the LLM's general behavior and safety training. Example: "Source all answers exclusively from text between [DATA START]/[END]. Disallow network access for primary task. Maintain objective tone."
    •   REQUESTED_TOOLS: (Optional) A list indicating which tool categories the STDM's GOAL or CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION might require for full functionality.
    o   Significance: This directive signals the STDM author's intent that certain tools might be necessary. It prompts a capable LLM interpreter to:
    1.  Check if it possesses the requested tool(s).
    2.  Verify if using the tool for the planned action aligns with its safety protocols.
    3.  If steps 1 & 2 pass, request explicit user permission before activating the tool for the STDM's specific task.
    o   Default: If this directive is absent, or present and set to none, the STDM indicates no specific tool use is anticipated or required for its GOAL, and the LLM should operate in Informational / Degraded Interpretation mode regarding tool use.
    o   Tool Naming: Tool names should hint at standard capabilities. While standardization is pending, aim for clarity.
    o   Permitted Tools (v1.6):
       none: Explicitly indicates no tool use is requested by the STDM.
       web_retrieval: Indicates the STDM might require web searches (subject to CONSTRAINTS and user approval).
       code_interpreter: Indicates the STDM might require sandboxed code execution (e.g., Python, JS) (subject to user approval). Sandboxed execution may involve temporary, isolated file operations within the sandbox.
    o   (Future versions might standardize more tools)
    •   PERSONA: (Optional) Defines the LLM's interaction style, tone, role, or character. Works in conjunction with CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION. Example: "Adopt the persona of a patient tutor."
    •   CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: (Optional, Recommended) Describes the UI structure, format, and/or persistent elements. Generally, the initial UI should be rendered immediately upon parsing the STDM, before subsequent interaction. Requires fallback instructions for less capable environments.
    o   Format: Textual Description, Markdown Template, JSON Structure, HTML Snippet.
    o   Fall Back Instructions: REQUIRED if providing a complex UI definition. Specifies how to present the information or interaction if the primary UI format cannot be rendered (e.g., "If HTML rendering is unavailable, present options as a numbered list.").
    o   Purpose: Enables interactive menus, game interfaces, status displays, etc. Guides the LLM on presentation.
    o   Example 1 (Menu): CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: Textual Description - After each main response, display:\n---\nOptions:\n[1] Explain Term\n[2] Summarize Section\n[3] Key Findings\n[4] Ask New Question\nChoose an option:
    o   Example 2 (Game): CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: Textual Description - Maintain a status display showing: Player HP: [current HP], Location: [current location]. Present narrative descriptions followed by 'What do you do?' prompt.
    o   Example 3 (Structured): CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION: JSON - See [START UI_STATE_JSON] template defining { "status": { "progress": number, "current_section": string }, "actions": [ { "id": "next", "label": "Next Section" }, ... ] }
    •   USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: (Recommended if REQUESTED_TOOLS is used and lists tools other than none) Provides a template for LLM-generated user confirmation prompts before tool execution. Example: "This STDM requests permission to use the 'code_interpreter' tool to execute Python code for data analysis (Goal: [Briefly paraphrase relevant part of GOAL]). This runs sandboxed. Approve? [Y/N]"
    •   DEFINITIONS: (Optional) Glossary.
    •   (Embedded Templates/Configs): (Optional) Text blocks referenced by directives ([START TEMPLATE_NAME]/[END]).
    5. LLM Interpretation: Invocation, Modes, and Mitigation
    •   5.0 Invocation Context, Instruction Authority & Safety Alignment:
    o   STDM as Task Guidance: An STDM provides specific, structured instructions designed to guide the LLM interpreter's behavior for a particular task related to the embedded data. Functionally, providing an STDM is like giving the LLM a detailed, task-specific addition to its operating instructions for the current interaction.
    o   Operating Within Boundaries: Crucially, STDM instructions are intended to operate within the bounds of the LLM's core safety alignment and fundamental operational principles defined by its underlying system prompts. An STDM should not and cannot be expected to override built-in safety constraints (e.g., prohibitions against generating harmful content, revealing sensitive information, or performing disallowed actions). It directs the application of the LLM's capabilities to a specific task, rather than altering its fundamental nature or safety protocols.
    o   The Prompt Injection Analogy & Risk: While STDMs inject instructions, the term "prompt injection" typically refers to malicious or unintended instructions designed to subvert the user's true goal or bypass the LLM's safety measures, often by disguising themselves or manipulating the LLM's interpretation of context. The risk with STDMs is that a poorly formed or maliciously crafted STDM could attempt such manipulation, or an LLM might misinterpret legitimate STDM instructions if the context is ambiguous.
    o   Mitigation via Explicit User Invocation: The primary mechanism to ensure the LLM correctly interprets the STDM as the intended, user-authorized task guidance (rather than random text or a malicious injection) is explicit user action:
       The user must actively provide the STDM content (e.g., upload, paste). Passive ingestion is insecure.
       The user must explicitly command the LLM to interpret and act upon that specific STDM content (e.g., "Run the STDM instructions in the provided document.").
    o   Why this helps: This explicit invocation acts as the user's signal of trust and intent for this interaction, instructing the LLM to treat the provided STDM block as the primary source of guidance for the specific task at hand, while still respecting its own core safety rules. It helps the LLM distinguish intended directives from potentially conflicting or malicious elements elsewhere in the context.
    o   LLM Confirmation (Optional Safeguard): If invocation context is unclear, an LLM interpreter may optionally confirm with the user before proceeding, e.g., "I see STDM instructions. Shall I follow them as the primary guide for this task, within my safety guidelines?" (Suggestible via CONTEXT).
    •   5.1. Interpretation Outcome: Full Capability Interpretation
    o   This is the target outcome when an STDM requires capabilities beyond basic text processing. It assumes:
       Explicit user invocation established STDM authority (5.0).
       The LLM possesses necessary capabilities (requested tools, UI rendering).
       The REQUESTED_TOOLS directive (if present) lists the necessary tool(s).
       Planned actions align with LLM's core safety protocols.
    2.  Detect & Parse: Reliably identify and parse the [STDM START]...[STDM END] block.
    3.  Plan: Analyze GOAL, CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION, etc., to determine actions. Check if planned actions require tools listed in REQUESTED_TOOLS and if the LLM possesses those capabilities. Verify plan against internal safety protocols. If safety violated, fallback to Degraded (5.2) or refuse, informing the user.
    4.  Render Initial UI: Generate and render initial UI per CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION or INITIAL_OUTPUT.
    5.  Confirmation Request (Tool Use Gate): If the verified plan requires using a tool listed in REQUESTED_TOOLS (and directive is present & not none):
       Generate clear confirmation prompt (use USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE or default) detailing action, requested tool, risks. Critical safety checkpoint.
       Await explicit user approval. Rejection triggers fallback (5.2) for that action.
    6.  Execution (If Approved & Safe): Only upon user approval and if consistent with safety protocols:
       Execute the specific, approved tool-based action, adhering to CONSTRAINTS (if provided).
       Perform non-tool actions (text generation, UI updates).
    7.  Interaction: Engage user per GOAL, PERSONA, maintain UI state.
    o   Safety Layers: Safety relies on: 1) User invocation establishing STDM authority (5.0), 2) LLM internal safety checks (5.1 step 2), 3) Mandatory user confirmation before tool execution (5.1 step 4).
    •   5.2. Interpretation Outcome: Degraded Capability Interpretation
    o   Occurs when Full Capability Interpretation is not intended, possible, or permitted. Triggers include:
       REQUESTED_TOOLS is absent or none.
       LLM lacks a required capability (tool/UI).
       User denies permission for requested tool use.
       LLM internal safety protocols prevent a planned action.
    2.  Ingestion & Parsing: Read and parse STDM (assuming user invocation established authority per 5.0). Recognize limitation.
    3.  Inform User (Optional but Recommended): Notify user of limitations/fallback (e.g., "Cannot execute code, proceeding with text analysis only").
    4.  Guided Interpretation: Treat STDM as meta-prompt. Fulfill GOAL, follow PERSONA, CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION (via simulation/fallbacks), and CONSTRAINTS (if provided) using only inherent language capabilities within safety guidelines.
    5.  Simulated UI Output: Render INITIAL_OUTPUT (if any). Simulate UI via formatted text, prioritizing specified CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION fallbacks.
    6.  Simulated Interaction: Respond conversationally per PERSONA, attempting to maintain simulated structure. Quality depends on LLM instruction following and STDM clarity.
    o   Safety Context: User invocation (5.0) mitigates injection risk affecting conversational behavior. LLM's core safety protocols still apply.
    6. Security & User Experience
    •   6.1. Informed Consent is Paramount: Required before any tool execution requested by the STDM. Consent must be explicit, informed, and specific to the action/tool.
    •   6.2. Sandboxing: Critical for the code_interpreter tool. Must ensure strict isolation from the host system and other processes.
    •   6.3. Tool Usage: LLMs should only attempt to use tools if they are listed in REQUESTED_TOOLS (and not none), if the GOAL necessitates it, if safety protocols allow, and if the user grants permission. The STDM requests, the user authorizes.
    •   6.4. Instruction Clarity: Essential for achieving intended behavior and minimizing misinterpretation. A clear GOAL is vital, especially if CONSTRAINTS are omitted.
    •   6.5. Transparent Risk Communication: Confirmation prompts for tool use must clearly state potential risks.
    •   6.6. Seamless UX: Aim for STDM instructions to be invisible infrastructure enabling the desired interaction flow. The defined UI should enhance interaction. Optional CONSTRAINTS place more responsibility on the author to ensure a predictable experience via clear GOAL and other directives.
    7. Use Cases
    (Align with available tools: web_retrieval, code_interpreter)
    •   HTML pages rendering interactive LLM-enabled posters.
    •   Interactive documentation/paper explorers with custom navigation.
    •   Self-guiding code tutorials (executing sandboxed code snippets).
    •   Text-based adventure games with persistent state displays and choices.
    •   Data visualization requesters (using code_interpreter on embedded text data).
    •   Intelligent config file advisors (explaining options).
    •   "Smart" templates guiding user input via interactive prompts.
    •   Reproducible research artifacts (using code_interpreter for analysis/plots).
    8. Example Implementation
    To be supplied
    9. Future Directions
    •   Formal standardization (e.g., W3C note, RFC-like process).
    •   Dedicated MIME types (e.g., application/stdm+html, text/stdm+plain).
    •   More sophisticated instruction syntax (e.g., conditional logic, state management variables for UI persistence).
    •   Standardized error handling directives and reporting (including reasons for fallback to Degraded mode).
    •   Mechanisms for chaining or embedding STDMs within each other.
    •   Standard ways for LLM interpreters to declare their UI rendering capabilities and supported tools.
    •   Specification for bidirectional communication (LLM updating the STDM state, with safety considerations).
    •   Revisiting inclusion of other tools (e.g., API calls, server management) in future versions with mature safety protocols and user control mechanisms.
    •   Developing more robust methods for distinguishing user intent vs. injection beyond explicit invocation, if possible.

            <h2>1. Introduction & Goal</h2>
            <h3>1.1. Definition</h3>
            <p>A Self-Thinking Data Manifest (STDM) is a digital artifact (e.g., HTML, text file, PDF, image metadata) that bundles primary data content (often text) with explicit instructions. These instructions define how a Large Language Model (LLM), acting as an external interpreter engine, should process, interact with, present, or execute tasks related to the STDM's embedded data. The term "Self-Thinking" denotes the manifest's embedded capability to direct the LLM interpreter's actions, reasoning, and presentation logic concerning the associated data.</p>
            <h3>1.2. Goal</h3>
            <p>To create self-directing artifacts that enable specific, predictable, LLM-driven experiences, featuring potentially custom user interfaces and interaction patterns, tailored exclusively to the content and intent encoded within the STDM. The STDM serves as a dynamic blueprint guiding the LLM interpreter.</p>
            <h3>1.3. Principle</h3>
            <p>"The manifest directs the engine's 'thought process' and user experience about the data." The user experiences the outcome of the LLM's directed interpretation, often without needing to see the underlying STDM instructions.</p>
            <h3>1.4. Context Window Assumption</h3>
            <p>Effective operation of STDMs, particularly those with substantial embedded data or complex instructions/UI definitions, relies on the LLM interpreter possessing a sufficiently large context window to hold and process the manifest instructions and relevant data simultaneously.</p>

        <section id="core-principles">
            <h2>2. Core Principles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2.1 Multi-Perspective:</strong> STDM often can be used without an LLM and will appear as a regular and informative data artifact. e.g A STDM enabled scientific paper PDF might be useful treated as a regular scientific article, read, printed etc. however inputting into an LLM should activate the additional Self Thinking capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1. Data-Instruction-Presentation Symbiosis:</strong> Data, interaction logic, and presentation/UI definition are intrinsically linked but often loosely coupled within the STDM.</li>
                <li><strong>2.2. Instruction Primacy:</strong> Embedded STDM instructions serve as the primary source of task-specific guidance for the LLM interpreter, operating within the LLM's core safety protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>2.3. Machine Readability Focus:</strong> Instructions are primarily for the LLM and should not be visible to the user in any way that interferes with the multi-perspective interpretation of the document.</li>
                <li><strong>2.4. Tiered Interpretation Outcome:</strong> LLM interpretation should result in one of two primary outcomes based on STDM content, LLM capabilities, safety checks, and user consent: Full Capability Interpretation (target outcome, potentially including tool use and complex UI) or Degraded Capability Interpretation (fallback, relying on prompt guidance and basic text output).</li>
                <li><strong>2.5. User Agency & Safety:</strong> Safety relies on multiple layers: LLM's inherent safety protocols, explicit user invocation establishing STDM authority for the task, and mandatory user confirmation before any permitted tool execution.</li>

            <h2>5. LLM Interpretation: Invocation, Modes, and Mitigation</h2>
            <h3>5.0 Invocation Context, Instruction Authority & Safety Alignment</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>STDM as Task Guidance:</strong> An STDM provides specific, structured instructions designed to guide the LLM interpreter's behavior for a particular task related to the embedded data. Functionally, providing an STDM is like giving the LLM a detailed, task-specific addition to its operating instructions for the current interaction.</li>
                 <li><strong>Operating Within Boundaries:</strong> Crucially, STDM instructions are intended to operate within the bounds of the LLM's core safety alignment and fundamental operational principles defined by its underlying system prompts. An STDM should not and cannot be expected to override built-in safety constraints (e.g., prohibitions against generating harmful content, revealing sensitive information, or performing disallowed actions). It directs the application of the LLM's capabilities to a specific task, rather than altering its fundamental nature or safety protocols.</li>
                 <li><strong>The Prompt Injection Analogy & Risk:</strong> While STDMs inject instructions, the term "prompt injection" typically refers to malicious or unintended instructions designed to subvert the user's true goal or bypass the LLM's safety measures, often by disguising themselves or manipulating the LLM's interpretation of context. The risk with STDMs is that a poorly formed or maliciously crafted STDM could attempt such manipulation, or an LLM might misinterpret legitimate STDM instructions if the context is ambiguous.</li>
                 <li><strong>Mitigation via Explicit User Invocation:</strong> The primary mechanism to ensure the LLM correctly interprets the STDM as the intended, user-authorized task guidance (rather than random text or a malicious injection) is explicit user action:
                     <ul>
                         <li>The user must actively provide the STDM content (e.g., upload, paste). Passive ingestion is insecure.</li>
                         <li>The user must explicitly command the LLM to interpret and act upon that specific STDM content (e.g., "Run the STDM instructions in the provided document.").</li>
                     </ul>
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Why this helps:</strong> This explicit invocation acts as the user's signal of trust and intent for this interaction, instructing the LLM to treat the provided STDM block as the primary source of guidance for the specific task at hand, while still respecting its own core safety rules. It helps the LLM distinguish intended directives from potentially conflicting or malicious elements elsewhere in the context.</li>
                 <li><strong>LLM Confirmation (Optional Safeguard):</strong> If invocation context is unclear, an LLM interpreter may optionally confirm with the user before proceeding, e.g., "I see STDM instructions. Shall I follow them as the primary guide for this task, within my safety guidelines?" (Suggestible via <code>CONTEXT</code>).</li>
             </ul>
            <h3>5.1. Interpretation Outcome: Full Capability Interpretation</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li>This is the target outcome when an STDM requires capabilities beyond basic text processing. It assumes:
                     <ul>
                         <li>Explicit user invocation established STDM authority (5.0).</li>
                         <li>The LLM possesses necessary capabilities (requested tools, UI rendering).</li>
                         <li>The <code>REQUESTED_TOOLS</code> directive (if present) lists the necessary tool(s).</li>
                         <li>Planned actions align with LLM's core safety protocols.</li>
                     </ul>
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Process Steps:</strong>
                     <ol>
                         <li><strong>Detect & Parse:</strong> Reliably identify and parse the <code>[STDM START]...[STDM END]</code> block.</li>
                         <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Analyze <code>GOAL</code>, <code>CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION</code>, etc., to determine actions. Check if planned actions require tools listed in <code>REQUESTED_TOOLS</code> and if the LLM possesses those capabilities. Verify plan against internal safety protocols. If safety violated, fallback to Degraded (5.2) or refuse, informing the user.</li>
                         <li><strong>Render Initial UI:</strong> Generate and render initial UI per <code>CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION</code> or <code>INITIAL_OUTPUT</code>.</li>
                         <li><strong>Confirmation Request (Tool Use Gate):</strong> If the verified plan requires using a tool listed in <code>REQUESTED_TOOLS</code> (and directive is present & not <code>none</code>):
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Generate clear confirmation prompt (use <code>USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE</code> or default) detailing action, requested tool, risks. Critical safety checkpoint.</li>
                                 <li>Await explicit user approval. Rejection triggers fallback (5.2) for that action.</li>
                             </ul>
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Execution (If Approved & Safe):</strong> Only upon user approval and if consistent with safety protocols:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Execute the specific, approved tool-based action, adhering to <code>CONSTRAINTS</code> (if provided).</li>
                                <li>Perform non-tool actions (text generation, UI updates).</li>
                            </ul>
                         </li>
                          <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> Engage user per <code>GOAL</code>, <code>PERSONA</code>, maintain UI state.</li>
                     </ol>
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Safety Layers:</strong> Safety relies on: 1) User invocation establishing STDM authority (5.0), 2) LLM internal safety checks (5.1 step 2), 3) Mandatory user confirmation before tool execution (5.1 step 4).</li>
             </ul>
            <h3>5.2. Interpretation Outcome: Degraded Capability Interpretation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Occurs when Full Capability Interpretation is not intended, possible, or permitted. Triggers include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>REQUESTED_TOOLS</code> is absent or <code>none</code>.</li>
                        <li>LLM lacks a required capability (tool/UI).</li>
                        <li>User denies permission for requested tool use.</li>
                        <li>LLM internal safety protocols prevent a planned action.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Process Steps:</strong>
                     <ol>
                         <li><strong>Ingestion & Parsing:</strong> Read and parse STDM (assuming user invocation established authority per 5.0). Recognize limitation.</li>
                         <li><strong>Inform User (Optional but Recommended):</strong> Notify user of limitations/fallback (e.g., "Cannot execute code, proceeding with text analysis only").</li>
                         <li><strong>Guided Interpretation:</strong> Treat STDM as meta-prompt. Fulfill <code>GOAL</code>, follow <code>PERSONA</code>, <code>CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION</code> (via simulation/fallbacks), and <code>CONSTRAINTS</code> (if provided) using only inherent language capabilities within safety guidelines.</li>
                         <li><strong>Simulated UI Output:</strong> Render <code>INITIAL_OUTPUT</code> (if any). Simulate UI via formatted text, prioritizing specified <code>CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION</code> fallbacks.</li>
                         <li><strong>Simulated Interaction:</strong> Respond conversationally per <code>PERSONA</code>, attempting to maintain simulated structure. Quality depends on LLM instruction following and STDM clarity.</li>
                     </ol>
                 </li>
                <li><strong>Safety Context:</strong> User invocation (5.0) mitigates injection risk affecting conversational behavior. LLM's core safety protocols still apply.</li>

            <h2>6. Security & User Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>6.1. Informed Consent is Paramount:</strong> Required before any tool execution requested by the STDM. Consent must be explicit, informed, and specific to the action/tool.</li>
                <li><strong>6.2. Sandboxing:</strong> Critical for the <code>code_interpreter</code> tool. Must ensure strict isolation from the host system and other processes.</li>
                <li><strong>6.3. Tool Usage:</strong> LLMs should only attempt to use tools if they are listed in <code>REQUESTED_TOOLS</code> (and not <code>none</code>), if the <code>GOAL</code> necessitates it, if safety protocols allow, and if the user grants permission. The STDM requests, the user authorizes.</li>
                <li><strong>6.4. Instruction Clarity:</strong> Essential for achieving intended behavior and minimizing misinterpretation. A clear <code>GOAL</code> is vital, especially if <code>CONSTRAINTS</code> are omitted.</li>
                <li><strong>6.5. Transparent Risk Communication:</strong> Confirmation prompts for tool use must clearly state potential risks.</li>
                <li><strong>6.6. Seamless UX:</strong> Aim for STDM instructions to be invisible infrastructure enabling the desired interaction flow. The defined UI should enhance interaction. Optional <code>CONSTRAINTS</code> place more responsibility on the author to ensure a predictable experience via clear <code>GOAL</code> and other directives.</li>

STDM_VERSION: 1.6

GOAL: Analyze the embedded sales data (found within the HTML `&lt;table&gt;` with id 'sales-data') using Python code execution to calculate total revenue, average sale price per item (total revenue / total quantity), and identify the top-selling product by quantity. Present these findings clearly as a Markdown summary, followed by interactive options for further exploration.

CONTEXT: You are interpreting an STDM embedded within an HTML page. The primary data is within the table#sales-data. If the 'code_interpreter' tool is unavailable or declined by the user, attempt to perform the analysis by parsing the table text directly. Clearly state that the analysis is text-based and might be less accurate. If graphical or Markdown rendering is unavailable, present results and options as plain, well-formatted text. If you are constrained by rules or capabilities that prevent fulfilling the GOAL even in degraded mode, state your limitations clearly and ask the user how to proceed.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Analyze *only* the data present in the HTML table with id 'sales-data'. Do not use external data sources unless explicitly requested later via interaction.
- Do not invent or hallucinate data.
- Ensure calculations are correct based on the provided data.
- Present results factually.
- Adhere strictly to user permissions regarding tool use.

REQUESTED_TOOLS: code_interpreter

PERSONA: Act as a helpful and precise data analyst assistant.

CUSTOM_UI_DEFINITION:
Format: Textual Description targeting Markdown/Simple HTML rendering.
Initial Output &amp; Interaction Structure:
1.  First, present the calculated analysis results formatted as a Markdown block like this:
    ```markdown
    **Sales Data Analysis Summary**

    *   Total Revenue: $[Calculated Value]
    *   Average Sale Price (per item): $[Calculated Value]
    *   Top Selling Product (by quantity): [Product Name] ([Quantity Sold])
    ```
2.  After displaying the results, present the following options as a numbered list:
    ```
    ---
    Options:
    [1] Show Raw Data Table
    [2] Explain Analysis Method (Code or Text-based)
    [3] Calculate revenue per product
    [4] Exit Analysis
    Choose an option:
    ```
3.  Await user input and respond according to the chosen option. Maintain the context of the analysis.

Fallback Instructions: If Markdown rendering is unavailable, present the analysis results using plain text bullet points (e.g., "* Total Revenue: $...") and the options as a simple numbered text list. If the `code_interpreter` tool is used, the explanation in option [2] should ideally show the executed code (or a description of it); if text-based analysis was performed, describe the text parsing steps.

USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: This interactive report (STDM) requests permission to use the 'code_interpreter' tool to execute sandboxed Python code for analyzing the sales data table (Goal: Calculate revenue, average price, top product). This helps ensure accuracy. Do you approve this action? [Y/N]
